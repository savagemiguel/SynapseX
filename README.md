For the workshopdownload.sh you MUST RUN IT UNDER SUDO. It will fail due to permissions if you do not.

Any of the current IDs in your workshop.txt file will not download. It'll attempt to download it and then skip it with an error because it already exists. That part I am still working on so that it doesn't provide any error, it'll say it's skipping it.
